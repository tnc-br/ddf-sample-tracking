If the p-value is below a target threshold, it is considered 'not likely' to have come from the claimed location. The threshold is chosen to achieve a precision of at least 95%.",
  "methodologyP2": "The reference distribution of δ18O is obtained from a geographical mapping of isotopic measurements (i.e. an 'isoscape') and their variability over Brazil's geography. This isoscape is built using a variational neural network trained using the isotope measurements from collected reference wood samples, their precise harvest location, and various climatic factors such as temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure, etc.",
